I'm interested in topics such as Quantitative Finance, High Frequency Trading, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and General Data Science Techniques. I'm currently master's student in Statistics at [ETH Zurich - Swiss Federal Institute of Technology](https://ethz.ch/en.html).

Before joining ETH, I held both master's and bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Munich (LMU)](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) with strong focus on machine learning. I've gathered professional experience in quantitative disciplines with [Citigroup](https://de.citifirst.com/en-de/), [Société Générale](https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/en/solutions/markets/equities/), [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/de/de/pages/finance/topics/center-for-process-bionics.html) and [Telefonica Germany](https://www.telefonica.de/home-corporate-en.html).
